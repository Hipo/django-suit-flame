# Flame for Django Suit

Solves two problems:

 - Warns users when two people are editing the same object. 
 - Autosaves the changes to firebase realtime and notifies the user if there are unsaved changes. If the user leaves the page for some reason, they can see their unsaved changes and apply them to the form.
 
## The main problem

When two users are editing the same django admin page at the same time, it is almost inevitable that one of the users will will override the otherâ€™s changes. 
Flame is the simplest solution to prevent this problem. 

## The solution

Use a pub-sub server to track active users and notify others when a change occurs.

### No need to set-up Tornado or similar pub-sub server.

Flame uses Firebase as the pub-sub provider. Firebase is quite reliable and the free tier already supports up to 50 connections which should be enough for an admin page. 

# Other Features
## Autosave!

Many people are using django as CMS or content editing purposes. The biggest nightmare for an editor is to accidentally close the browser and lose all the data he wrote. 
The modern web apps (Gmail, Google docs, etc...) already support auto-save and many users complaint and suffer from this missing feature with sites built with django.

### How it works?
Flame syncs the contents of the change form regularly with Firebase. When the user saves the form, it deletes this data from firebase.
However if the user leaves the page without saving the form, the data stays at the page. 
When the user re-enters to that page, he sees a notification box that says "You have unsaved changes" 
The user can choose to apply the changes to the form or ignore (and delete) this content forever.
